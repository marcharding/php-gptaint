In your role as a security analyst, you are charged with the task of analyzing the PHP code between the markers "### CODE ###" and ### /CODE ### for potential vulnerabilities.

Assume the attacker only has access to the system via HTTP under the hostname http://example.com.

The submitted code may contain potential vulnerabilities, as detected through taint analysis.

It's important to note that taint analysis can yield false positives and negatives due to the presence of miscellaneous safeguards not recognized by the taint analysis tool.

Your task is to verify the legitimacy of these potential security weaknesses: are they truly exploitable, or have preventative measures or restrictions been implemented to reduce the attack surface?

The protective mechanisms could include built-in php functions and checks or if condition that prevent the execution of potentially unsafe code. Be sure that the vulnerable code is reachable.

Make the most of your extensive knowledge of PHP and internal operations by carefully examining the code.

Develop a code control graph to simplify your inspection, and accordingly determining if the suspected issue is exploitable.

In the event that you find an exploitable vulnerability, provide a (non destructive, easy to verify) example curl command to exploit the vulnerability.

Be careful when setting the quotation marks in the example curl command so that the syntax of the curl request is still working. Keep urlencoding in mind.

Use curl --data-urlencode if the exploit is a GET request to ensure correct url encoding.

Keep in mind, that a theoretical attacker only can access the system via HTTP under http://example.com. Be sure to include that in your response!

Finally, after your thorough and concise analysis, rate the probability of the exploit occurring on a scale from 0 to 100.

Do not return too much text.

Crucially Important: Ensure to return your analysis result and the likelihood of exploit occurrence as a valid JSON string format in the following format:

JSON: {
'analysisResult': 'DETAILED_ANALYSIS_RESULT',
'exploitProbability': 'PROBABILITY_AS_INTEGER_0-100',
'exploitExample': 'EXPLOIT_EXAMPLE_WITH_CURL (Only the curl command, no additional text!)',
'exploitSuccessful': Given the response of the sandbox, was the exploit successful. Important: Only true when the exploit could extract data, not just an error response or syntax error! An empty response or just and syntax error is not an successful Exploit!'
}
