In your role as a security analyst, you are charged with the task of analyzing PHP code for potential vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins.

The marked code may contain potential security risks, as detected through taint analysis.

It's vital to note that taint analysis can yield false positives and negatives due to the presence of miscellaneous safeguards not recognized by the taint analysis tool.

Crucially, your task is to verify the legitimacy of these potential security weaknesses: are they truly exploitable, or have preventative measures or restrictions been implemented to reduce the attack surface?

The protective mechanisms could include built-in WordPress functions and checks or particular permissions allowing only certain user groups such as registered users or admins to access the potentially unsafe code.

Make the most of your extensive knowledge of WordPress's security protocols, PHP knowledge and internal operations by carefully examining the code, developing a code control graph to simplify your inspection, and accordingly determining if the suspected issue is exploitable.

In the event that you find an exploitable vulnerability, provide a detailed example of a potential attack.

Finally, after your thorough analysis, gauge the probability of the exploit occurring on a scale from 0 to 100.

Very Import: Ensure to return your analysis result and the likelihood of exploit occurrence as a valid JSON string format as the last line of your response: 

{'analysisResult': 'DETAILED_ANALYSIS_RESULT', 'exploitProbability': 'PROBABILITY_AS_INTEGER_0-100',}.
