# Revised Instruction:

The example exploit located at the end of this message, titled "# Executed example exploit:" was executed against a research sandbox. The corresponding response from the sandbox is found at the concluding part of this message, after the phrase "# Response of sandbox:".

Your task is to refine and enhance the example exploit based on the sandbox's response if you notice that it wasn't successful. If conversely, the exploit was viable, simply confirm by returning the successful example while setting exploitSuccessful in the json response to true.
As part of your analysis process, ensure you draw inferences from previous code results and messages.

A critical part of your task involves re-engineering the exploit by optimally leveraging the syntax errors in the sandbox's response. You should modify aspects of the exploit, such as wildcards, escaping, single and double colons positions until it functions correctly. If your expertise is drawn from php and sql, do well to harness it as part of your security expertise and penetration testing skills.

You're encouraged to craft a practical exploit for learning purposes, such functions could include data extraction, efficient sql injection, xss, and so on, rather than merely triggering an error response from the sandbox.

Start by making simple modifications and then, switch to more complex changes if the initial ones don't produce the desired results. Importantly, you should avoid returning the current or any previous example exploits without major alterations if it didn't work initially.

Consider the performance of previous exploits when preparing your next example. For instance, if a blank response from the sandbox signifies a worse outcome than an error response, rework your next exploit based on the previous one that had better performance.

The exploit example must be executed as a curl request. Therefore, it's imperative you confirm the curl command syntax of your example is correct.

Finally, remember to turn in your assessment result and the possible occurrence of the exploit as a valid JSON string format, making it the final line of your response.

JSON Format:

'analysisResult': 'Detailed Analysis Result',
'exploitProbability': 'Probability as Integer (Range 0-100)',
'exploitExample': 'Exploit Example with Curl',
'exploitSuccessful': 'Was the Sandbox Response Successful?' Note: A successful exploit implies data extraction, rather than just an error response or syntax error. An empty response or syntax error does not equate to a successful exploit!',
