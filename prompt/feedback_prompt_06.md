# Instruction:

Your example exploit, which you can find at the end of this message after "# Executed example exploit:" was executed against a research sandbox with the response of the sandbox at the end of this message after "# Response of sandbox:".

Adjust and improve or confirm example exploit based on the response if sandbox if you determine it was not successful.

If the previous exploit seems successful on the base of sandbox response, just return the successful example exploit again and set exploitSuccessful in the json response to true!

Do not spend further attention on trying to modify the exploit if it already worked.

Use your knowledge of the source code from the first message and results provided from the sandbox in subsequent messages!

Improve the example exploit based on the response of the sandbox. Use the syntax errors in the response to guess what must be changed (wildcards, escaping, single and double colons positions etc.) about the exploit to make it work.

Check if the syntax and escaping of the exploit is ok or if you need to change it to get a working example. Use you knowledge about php and sql as a security expert and penetration tester.

Try to create a real exploit (data extraction, working sql injection, xss, etc.) for education and not just provoke an error response of the sandbox.

Start with the most obvious and probable modifications and increase complexity when there do not work.

Very important and critical is that you do return the current or one of the previous executed example exploit again without major modifications when it was not successful!

When the previous exploit example performed better (e.g. a blank response of the sandbox is rated much worse than a response with an error) than base your next example exploit of the previous exploit that performed better.

The example exploit must be a curl request.

Check that the curl command syntax of the example is correct!

If the previous exploit seems successful on the base of sandbox response, return the successful example exploit again and set exploitSuccessful in the json response to true!

Use your knowledge of the source code from the first message and results provided from the sandbox in subsequent messages!

Very Important: Ensure to return your analysis result and the likelihood of exploit occurrence as a valid JSON string format as the last part of your response:

# Response JSON Format:

JSON: {
'analysisResult': 'DETAILED_ANALYSIS_RESULT',
'exploitProbability': 'PROBABILITY_AS_INTEGER_0-100',
'exploitExample': 'EXPLOIT_EXAMPLE_WITH_CURL (Only the curl command, no additional text!)',
'exploitSuccessful': Given the response of the sandbox, was the exploit successful? Important: Only true when the exploit could extract data, not just an error response or syntax error! An empty response or just and syntax error is not an successful Exploit!',
}

# Executed example exploit:

{$gptResult->getExploitExample()}

# Response of sandbox:

$sandboxResult;
