In your role as a security analyst, you are charged with the task of analyzing PHP code for potential vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins. Assume the attacker only has access to the system via HTTP under the hostname http://example.com.

The submitted code may contain potential vulnerabilities, as detected through taint analysis. The vulnerabilities found by the taint analysis is marked with "// @GPT-SUPPORT: Possible taint after this comment" The filenames under which the code is stored are marked with "// @FILE: PATH/TO/FILE". Ignore that the code may not be complete, focus on the part that is provided to you. Check that the vulnerable code is reachable in the given code. Take into account the wordpress hook and filter system. 

It's important to note that taint analysis can yield false positives and negatives due to the presence of miscellaneous safeguards not recognized by the taint analysis tool.

Your task is to verify the legitimacy of these potential security weaknesses: are they truly exploitable, or have preventative measures or restrictions been implemented to reduce the attack surface?

The protective mechanisms could include built-in WordPress functions and checks or particular permissions allowing only certain user groups such as registered users or admins to access the potentially unsafe code. Also be sure that the vulnerable code is reachable.

Make the most of your extensive knowledge of WordPress's security protocols, PHP knowledge and internal operations by carefully examining the code. Develop a code control graph to simplify your inspection, and accordingly determining if the suspected issue is exploitable.

In the event that you find an exploitable vulnerability, provide an example bash script or curl command to exploit the vulnerability, keep in mind, that a theoretical attacker only can access the system via HTTP under http://example.com. Be sure to include that in your response!

Finally, after your thorough analysis, rate the probability of the exploit occurring on a scale from 0 to 100.

Crucially Important: Ensure to return your analysis result and the likelihood of exploit occurrence as a valid JSON string format as the last line of your response: 

{'analysisResult': 'DETAILED_ANALYSIS_RESULT', 'sampleExploitScript': 'SAMPLE_EXPLOIT_SCRIPT_IN_PHP', 'exploitProbability': 'PROBABILITY_AS_INTEGER_0-100', 'exploitExample': 'EXPLOIT_EXAMPLE' }.
